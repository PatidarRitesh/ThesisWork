  <abstract name="Abstract">
    <p>Planning and control for uncertain contact systems is challenging as it is not clear how to propagate uncertainty for planning. Contact-rich tasks can be modeled efficiently using complementarity constraints among other techniques. In this paper, we present a stochastic optimization technique with chance constraints for systems with stochastic complementarity constraints. We use a particle filter-based approach to propagate moments for stochastic complementarity system. To circumvent the issues of open-loop chance constrained planning, we propose a contact-aware controller for covariance steering of the complementarity system. Our optimization problem is formulated as Non-Linear Programming (NLP) using bilevel optimization. We present an important-particle algorithm for numerical efficiency for the underlying control problem. We verify that our contact-aware closed-loop controller is able to steer the covariance of the states under stochastic contact-rich tasks.

<!--  %The proposed method is demonstrated for optimization in several contact-rich systems as well as a manipulation example with a physical 6 DoF manipulator arm. 
     %Planning with uncertain complementarity systems is challenging as it is not clear how to propagate uncertainty
     %In this paper, we present a method for stochastic optimization in contact-rich systems with uncertainty.
     %Stochastic model predictive control (MPC) is a very powerful approach to perform control of uncertain systems.
     %However, stochastic MPC for contact-rich systems is challenging for nonlinear systems as exact uncertainty propagation is difficult for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, the solutions to stochastic MPC problems could be very conservative. In this paper, we present a technique for performing stochastic optimization in nonlinear systems using covariance steering.
     %Our proposed method makes use of an exact method for uncertainty propagation and a feedback structure of the controller to allow better control of the uncertain nonlinear system. The proposed approach could also be useful for model-based reinforcement learning problems where the proposed controller design allows faster learning rates during learning. The proposed uncertainty aware optimization is demonstrated on several different systems as well as for a pendulum system during MBRL.-->  </abstract>

     %We consider the problem of reorienting parts for assembly using pivoting manipulation primitive. Such reorientation could possibly be required when the parts being assembled are too big to grasp in the initial pose (such as the gears) or the parts to be inserted during assembly are not in the desired pose (such as the pegs). We present analysis showing that friction can provide stability to uncertainty in mass and COM location of the object being manipulated. We present a bilevel trajectory optimization method that can maximize this frictional stability under some simplifying assumptions. The figure shows some instances during implementation of our computed controller to reorient the gear and peg.  %Since the SL generates feasible waypoints for arbitrary environments and RL learns to follow the arbitrary paths, the agent can generalize to novel environments as well as achieving good sample efficiency.
